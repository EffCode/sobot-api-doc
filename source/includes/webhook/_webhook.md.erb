# Webhook
Webhooks are triggered when a customer performs an action or the status for a message a business sends a customer changes. You get a webhooks notification:

**When a customer performs an action:**
This alert lets you know when you have received a message. These can also be called "inbound notifications"
<ul>
<li>Sends a text message to the business</li>
<li>Sends an image, video, document, or sticker to the business</li>
<li>Sends contact information to the business</li>
<li>Sends location information to the business</li>
<li>Clicks a reply button set up by the business</li>
</ul>

**When the status for a message received by a business changes:**
This alert lets you know when the status of a message has changed â€”for example, the message has been read or delivered. These can also be called "outbound notifications"
<ul>
<li>delivered</li>
<li>sent</li>
<li>read</li>
</ul>
